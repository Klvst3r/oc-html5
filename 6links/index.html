	<p>Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>. Their scientific name means "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea">maritime</a> bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>, often living off fat reserves when no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a> is present. Because of their dependence on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice">sea ice</a>, polar bears are classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal">marine mammals</a>.</p>
